# AMSSync Plugin Configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: Add this file to .gitignore to protect your bot token!
#
# SECRETS: Discord token and guild ID can be set via environment variables:
#   - AMS_DISCORD_TOKEN: Bot token (takes precedence over config file)
#   - AMS_GUILD_ID: Guild ID (takes precedence over config file)

discord:
  # Your Discord bot token from https://discord.com/developers/applications
  token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"

  # Your Discord server (guild) ID for slash command registration
  # Right-click your server icon -> Copy ID (requires Developer Mode enabled)
  guild-id: "YOUR_GUILD_ID_HERE"

  # Retry configuration for Discord connection failures
  # Implements exponential backoff to handle transient network issues
  retry:
    # Enable/disable retry logic (true = retry on failure, false = fail immediately)
    enabled: true

    # Maximum number of connection attempts (including initial attempt)
    max-attempts: 5

    # Initial delay in seconds before first retry attempt
    initial-delay-seconds: 5

    # Maximum delay in seconds between retry attempts (caps exponential backoff)
    max-delay-seconds: 300

    # Exponential backoff multiplier (delay doubles with default 2.0)
    # Example delays with defaults: 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s
    backoff-multiplier: 2.0

  # Timeout protection for Discord operations
  # Prevents hanging operations from blocking the plugin
  timeout:
    # Enable/disable timeout protection (true = operations have timeout limits)
    enabled: true

    # Warning threshold in seconds - logs warning if operation takes longer
    # Helps identify slow operations before they timeout
    warning-threshold-seconds: 3

    # Hard timeout in seconds - operation is cancelled if it exceeds this
    # Prevents indefinite blocking of plugin operations
    # Discord initialization and API calls will abort after this duration
    hard-timeout-seconds: 10

  # Circuit breaker pattern for Discord API calls
  # Prevents cascading failures by failing fast when Discord is down
  circuit-breaker:
    # Enable/disable circuit breaker (true = automatic failure protection)
    enabled: true

    # Number of failures before opening circuit (failing fast)
    # Example: 5 failures = circuit opens and all requests fail immediately
    failure-threshold: 5

    # Time window in seconds for counting failures
    # Failures outside this window are not counted toward threshold
    # Example: 5 failures in 60 seconds = circuit opens
    time-window-seconds: 60

    # Cooldown period in seconds before attempting recovery
    # When circuit is open, wait this long before testing if service recovered
    # Example: After 30 seconds, circuit enters HALF_OPEN state to test recovery
    cooldown-seconds: 30

    # Number of consecutive successes needed to close circuit
    # In HALF_OPEN state, this many successes are needed to fully recover
    # Example: 2 successful calls = circuit closes and normal operation resumes
    success-threshold: 2

  # Player count presence display
  # Shows current player count in bot status and/or nickname
  presence:
    # Master enable/disable for all presence features
    enabled: true

    # Minimum seconds between Discord API updates
    # Discord rate limits presence updates to ~5/minute
    # Recommended: 30-60 seconds to stay well under limits
    min-update-interval-seconds: 30

    # Debounce delay in seconds
    # Waits this long after player join/quit before updating
    # Helps batch rapid changes (e.g., server restart, mass teleport)
    debounce-seconds: 5

    # Bot Activity/Status display
    # Shows in Discord under the bot's name (e.g., "Playing 12 players online")

      graceful-fallback: true
